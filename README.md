How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I ensure that my code is functional and secure by developing unit tests that verify behavior against specific requirements, including edge cases and invalid input handling. During the Contact Service project, for example, I tested for valid ID lengths, null values, and duplicate entries. Writing tests that intentionally attempt to break the system helps identify vulnerabilities early and ensures that validation logic is strong, reducing the likelihood of exploitable errors.



How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I interpret user needs by translating them into clear, enforceable requirements and then building my code and tests directly around those rules. In this project, each user requirement (such as ID uniqueness, string length limits, and date validation) was mapped to one or more specific unit tests. This direct alignment helps ensure that the software reflects what users expect and protects against misunderstandings or missing functionality.



How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software by focusing on simplicity, maintainability, and reliability first. I aim to design each class and method with a clear, single purpose, ensuring that services are easy to understand and modify. Throughout the Contact, Task, and Appointment services, I kept methods small and focused, which allowed me to write better tests and detect problems earlier. Prioritizing testability from the beginning improves software design and helps ensure long-term project success.
